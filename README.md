# Pacman-Game-using-iGraphics

## Introduction
 A simple re-implementation of the classic Pacman game using C, OpenGL based iGraphics Library in C++. It is my term project for CSE 102( Structured Programming Language Sessional) course during Level 1 Term 1 at BUET.
 
## How to run it
All necessary files are given. There is also a manual named "UserGuide" about installing using it with CodeBlocks IDE.

## Gameplay
Gameplay is just like classic one. 

* Up button for going up, left button for going left etc.
* Run away from the ghost to avoid get eaten.
* Eat the dots to get points.
* Eat the cherris and logences to get extra points and perks.
